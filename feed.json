				"title": "Week Notes 018 — W/E 6 August 2023",
				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<ul>\n<li>A mostly deskbound week with a few pleasant exceptions.</li>\n<li>I&rsquo;d left my VAT to the last minute, but turned it around within a day and a half. Having to sort my tax stuff four times a year is a revelation. I used to go through a year&rsquo;s worth of paper receipts and bank statements in January. The ensuing Hell Week would destroy any new year enthusiasm that I&rsquo;d been nuturing. Now, almost everything is digital, all business expenses go through one of two cards, and I&rsquo;ve only got three months of transactions to deal with so it&rsquo;s a fraction of the hassle.</li>\n<li>A couple of days of post work on two separate projects. Some last minute high res to grade and retouching on a handful of pictures. This year I started to use <a href=\"https://youtu.be/dKsUH02GdFg\">frequency separation</a>, rather than working on normal layers when retouching, and it&rsquo;s hugely improved the quality and subtlety of my results. It feels a little clunky at first, but it&rsquo;s well worth learning if you&rsquo;re unhappy with your skin work.</li>\n<li>I shot a studio visit with <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alice.irwin_\">Alice Irwin</a> at the end of the week. Alice works in multiple mediums: from large scale sculptures, to prints and drawings. I photographed her a few years ago as part of a series documenting artists at work. She&rsquo;s since moved spaces (within the same studio complex) and is now working with screen printing, rather than etching. She wanted some new pictures to show her current space and process, so we spent an afternoon printmaking, shooting, and catching up.\n<ul>\n<li>We probably spent too much time chatting — a lot of the pictures weren&rsquo;t usable because Alice is mid word&hellip; This is something to watch out for, especially when photographing interesting people. You&rsquo;re having a great time chatting and snapping, but you need to pause and make sure that you get the pictures that you came for. That said, there&rsquo;s still a reason to work this way: while you get fewer keepers, the successful pictures have a feeling of relaxed intimacy that I really like. When people aren&rsquo;t used to being photographed, the experience of being &lsquo;examined&rsquo; can make them feel uncomfortable, especially if you aren&rsquo;t talking or taking pictures. I prefer to shoot and talk liberally, so that the subject gets used to the sound and presence of the camera and it begins to disappear. You get a lot of crap pictures in the process, but you create a relaxed mood that&rsquo;s hard to find if you&rsquo;re precious about every frame.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>I revisited Matt Black&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.mattblack.com/american-geography\">American Geography</a> this week. Recently, I&rsquo;d thought about selling it, as it didn&rsquo;t grab me initially, but I wanted to give it another go. It hit much harder this time and is a body of work that I want to spend more time with. There is an unrelenting austerity, bordering on grimness, that is difficult to sit with, but the dignity with which the subjects are treated elevates it beyond poverty porn. Matt depicts the subjects as individuals, not ciphers for poverty, so it doesn&rsquo;t feel exploitative. And my understanding is that he spent time with them to gain their trust and learn about their stories. There&rsquo;s a lot of visual variety: stark street photos, environmental portraits and minimalistic, almost abstract landscapes. The dense typologies of cigarette packets, beggars' signs, and plastic forks didn&rsquo;t work for me initially, but I like how the patterns they form en masse sit with the diary page grids of text. The only thing I still struggle with, beyond the subject matter and bleakness, is the crunchy black and white grade. Sometimes it tips over into a high-contrast B&amp;W style reminiscent of bad street photography on Flickr.</li>\n<li>I noticed two potential problems with my M6 TTL — the rangefinder not quite lining up at infinity and the meter not working. I assumed that a dead battery was causing the latter, but a fresh one didn&rsquo;t bring it back to life. After some back and forth with a helpful Redditor, I tried cleaning the contacts with a pencil eraser. Success! &hellip;well at least for half a day.

She sat on the floor and is looking to the left of frame. There are prints in a pile on the floor to her right, as well as paintings leaning against the wall. Her long haired dachshund is laying to her left, looking at the camera\">\n\n- A mostly deskbound week with a few pleasant exceptions. \n- I'd left my VAT to the last minute, but turned it around within a day and a half. Having to sort my tax stuff four times a year is a revelation. I used to go through a year's worth of paper receipts and bank statements in January. The ensuing Hell Week would destroy any new year enthusiasm that I'd been nuturing. Now, almost everything is digital, all business expenses go through one of two cards, and I've only got three months of transactions to deal with so it's a fraction of the hassle. \n- A couple of days of post work on two separate projects. Some last minute high res to grade and retouching on a handful of pictures. This year I started to use [frequency separation](https://youtu.be/dKsUH02GdFg), rather than working on normal layers when retouching, and it's hugely improved the quality and subtlety of my results. It feels a little clunky at first, but it's well worth learning if you're unhappy with your skin work.\n- I shot a studio visit with [Alice Irwin](https://www.instagram.com/alice.irwin_) at the end of the week. Alice works in multiple mediums: from large scale sculptures, to prints and drawings. I photographed her a few years ago as part of a series documenting artists at work. She's since moved spaces (within the same studio complex) and is now working with screen printing, rather than etching. She wanted some new pictures to show her current space and process, so we spent an afternoon printmaking, shooting, and catching up. \n\t- We probably spent too much time chatting — a lot of the pictures weren't usable because Alice is mid word... This is something to watch out for, especially when photographing interesting people. You're having a great time chatting and snapping, but you need to pause and make sure that you get the pictures that you came for. That said, there's still a reason to work this way: while you get fewer keepers, the successful pictures have a feeling of relaxed intimacy that I really like. When people aren't used to being photographed, the experience of being 'examined' can make them feel uncomfortable, especially if you aren't talking or taking pictures. I prefer to shoot and talk liberally, so that the subject gets used to the sound and presence of the camera and it begins to disappear. You get a lot of crap pictures in the process, but you create a relaxed mood that's hard to find if you're precious about every frame. \n- I revisited Matt Black's [American Geography](https://www.mattblack.com/american-geography) this week. Recently, I'd thought about selling it, as it didn't grab me initially, but I wanted to give it another go. It hit much harder this time and is a body of work that I want to spend more time with. There is an unrelenting austerity, bordering on grimness, that is difficult to sit with, but the dignity with which the subjects are treated elevates it beyond poverty porn. Matt depicts the subjects as individuals, not ciphers for poverty, so it doesn't feel exploitative. And my understanding is that he spent time with them to gain their trust and learn about their stories. There's a lot of visual variety: stark street photos, environmental portraits and minimalistic, almost abstract landscapes. The dense typologies of cigarette packets, beggars' signs, and plastic forks didn't work for me initially, but I like how the patterns they form en masse sit with the diary page grids of text. The only thing I still struggle with, beyond the subject matter and bleakness, is the crunchy black and white grade. Sometimes it tips over into a high-contrast B&W style reminiscent of bad street photography on Flickr. \n- I noticed two potential problems with my M6 TTL — the rangefinder not quite lining up at infinity and the meter not working. I assumed that a dead battery was causing the latter, but a fresh one didn't bring it back to life. After some back and forth with a helpful Redditor, I tried cleaning the contacts with a pencil eraser. Success! ...well at least for half a day. The meter has crapped out again, and now that I've loaded film into the camera to check that everything else is working, I can't fiddle with it. I'm going to finish my current roll and then see what I can do. \n- Six month catch-up with some of the couples from our pre-natal course. Nice to see everyone, especially those that we haven't been seeing socially in the intervening time. The large skylight in the pub's dining area was creating a lovely slice of sunlight that cut along the edge of our table, so I started to take pictures. I was extra grateful for thought that the designers of the Ricoh GRIII put into its ergonomics as I was balancing a baby on one hip and shooting with my free hand.

The ground he covered and the variety of scenes that he witnessed are mind-boggling. And this doesn&rsquo;t even speak to the incisive eye with which he captured them. On these recent flip-throughs I&rsquo;ve appreciated the classics like the angel on the bike or the rocket man, but also fallen in love with pictures that I didn&rsquo;t even realise were in the book.

I used to make a song and dance of sitting down with a photobook — waiting for good light and uninterrupted time. As a result, I rarely looked at them. Now, because I grab and browse when I have a spare five minutes, I've spent more time with my photobooks than I had in the last year. [_Exiles_ by Koudelka](https://www.magnumphotos.com/newsroom/society/josef-koudelka-exiles/) is the one that I keep returning too. The ground he covered and the variety of scenes that he witnessed are mind-boggling. And this doesn't even speak to the incisive eye with which he captured them. On these recent flip-throughs I've appreciated the classics like the angel on the bike or the rocket man, but also fallen in love with pictures that I didn't even realise were in the book. He is a master of mood, light, and layering. I can't wait to read more about the life behind the pictures in [_The Making of Exiles_](https://ivorypress.com/en/libreria/shop/the-making-of-exiles/) which also awaits me on the shelf.\n",

Great guest list and nice flat, bright light. Lots of good combos and funny interactions (turns out that Paul Smith and Orlando Bloom are BFFs).  Fun evening all around: I took some nice pictures, caught up with a few friends and talked to a pop star about kombucha. Great music later on too.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://craigmod.com/\">Craig Mod&rsquo;s</a> pop-up newsletter <a href=\"https://craigmod.com/ridgeline/165/\">Basie! Bop! Jamaica!</a> blew me away. He travelled to 16+ jazz kissas in Japan&rsquo;s smaller cities, then wrote a multi-thousand word essay about each venue and released them day by day on the trip. Oh, and he also documented every one of them with stills, video and audio recordings&hellip; It would be a staggering feat of creative endurance regardless, but to top it off the writing is <em>excellent</em>. He captures the personalities of the owners, talks about the history of jazz in Japan and American, the qualities of the music and performers, nerds out over the sound systems, and finally weaves it all together with personal experience and socio-political commentary on contemporary culture. It&rsquo;s an improv masterpiece.</li>\n<li>Off the back of Craig Mod&rsquo;s series I&rsquo;ve been listening to a lot of the jazz albums that came up, like Chick Corea&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/6M0IAJHwQ6dFNtTkFsXCJc?si=o2V2oY35TlelNCxwQPMQHw\"><em>Return to Forever</em></a>  and Ryo Fukui&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/5Uny0mkKiVGDat7H6SNDyS?si=G6agtx4gTfaGuxiPn2feQQ\"><em>Scenery</em></a>, along with some old favourites of mine: <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/7Eoz7hJvaX1eFkbpQxC5PA?si=XUSKFYYUTs6LbI63-uWJrg\"><em>A Love Supreme</em></a>, <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/3uwufR7PwniMX7t3v4I5oB?si=V3GPHLk6SLyzuPiV4ZUVHw\"><em>Sunday at the Village Vanguard</em></a>, <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/0I8vpSE1bSmysN2PhmHoQg?si=5IPdEJqrS32n-yeaz1b1ug\"><em>The Köln Concert</em></a>, <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/1weenld61qoidwYuZ1GESA?si=tdrpxnxITaSUcEKO7w4gGg\"><em>Kind of Blue</em></a> and more.</li>\n<li>I&rsquo;ve been experimenting with <a href=\"https://imagen-ai.com/product/\">Imagen AI</a> to speed up the process of grading selects from large documentary or event shoots. When I&rsquo;m in control of the light and using manual settings for e.g. a portrait, it&rsquo;s easy to copy and paste styles across batches of images. However, on reportage-style shoots, the lighting conditions are unique to each image, so that approach doesn&rsquo;t work. Often I&rsquo;m using aperture priority and riding the exposure compensations dial, so the settings are inconsistent shot-to-shot. That means I have to tweak the brightness, contrast, and colour individually on 250–500 selects. And that is before I make use masks to make local corrections. I&rsquo;ve sped up with practice, and can finesse about a picture a minute, but that still adds up to hours of computer time. I&rsquo;ve used Imagen to create a custom AI profile trained on 3000+ of my pictures. I finish my edit, select the Lightroom catalogue within Imagen, choose the correct filters to bring up my edit and then upload them to the service. The magic grading pixies work their magic, they send me a notification when they&rsquo;re done, and then I download my edits. They aren&rsquo;t good enough to release — but I&rsquo;d say that they get me 80-90% there depending on the image. I need to tweak every second or third pic for brightness or white balance and apply any masks that I want to shape the light. I estimate that it&rsquo;s saving me at least two to three hours on every grade, which is a huge quality of life improvement. I particularly like that you re-upload your final edits to refine the model&rsquo;s understanding of your preferences. I&rsquo;ve nearly uploaded 6000 images, at which point they fine-tune your model, which according to Reddit is when it noticeably increases in power and usefulness. I&rsquo;ll see how my profile changes post fine-tuning and assess how the cost adds up, but I think it&rsquo;s likely to become a full time part of my process. They are releasing a beta version of a tool that is supposed to help with culling which I will play with, but I have had very mixed results with similar AI tools in the past. Generally they are great at identifying blinks or missed focussed, but bad at distinguishing between subtle facial expressions or gestures that mark out a great picture from a good one.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<ul>\n<li>Messed around with <a href=\"https://pi.ai/talk\">Pi AI</a>. It&rsquo;s an AI powered chatbot that you can talk to with a dedicated app, or in WhatsApp, Facebook, or Instagram DMs. It&rsquo;s interesting, in that it seems to parse meaning well and reply with useful information. Apart from the slightly formulaic responses, it does feel a lot like talking to a person. I asked it questions about creative programming for generative art and got a nice steer on a good language for beginners and resources to get me started. It also gave me some good jumping off points for exploring the tracker music production workflow with a <a href=\"https://dirtywave.com/\">Dirtywave M8</a>. Judging from the Discord, a lot of people are using it as a sounding board for creative ideas, to talk about philosophy and other &lsquo;big questions&rsquo; or as a journalling / talk therapy aid. I can imagine that it would be good to talk you down if you are spinning out as it has a very calming and friendly conversational style. Over the summer, I want to go deeper on the newly available AI tools to see how I can use them to aid my creative practice.</li>\n<li>Started <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58857438-the-man-from-the-future\"><em>The Man from The Future</em></a>, a book about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann\">John von Neumann</a>. I listened to a brilliant podcast with the author which made me want to delve deeper into the life of this seemingly extraordinary man. <a href=\"https://www.infiniteloopspodcast.com/ananyo-bhattacharya-john-von-neumann-the-man-from-the-future-ep151/\">It was a while ago, but I think that it was this one</a>. In honesty, I hadn&rsquo;t heard of him until a few years ago, when a physicist on a podcast declared that von Neumann was far and away the smartest person he had ever meet. Learning that this physicist also used to know Einstein made me really sit up and take notice. Who was this man whose genius outshone one of the most famous brains in history? Most impressive is the sheer breadth of his contributions: game theory, mathematics, quantum mechanics, nuclear physics, ballistics, cellular automata, early computing, and much more. A lot of his discoveries laid the groundwork for the most important technologies shaping the present. Here&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/p/ananyo-bhattacharya#details\">another interesting podcast with the author</a> that I listened to this week.</li>\n<li>I also started <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41812861-writing-tools\"><em>Writing Tools</em></a> by Roy Peter Clark, after a recommendation in <a href=\"https://www.robinsloan.com/newsletters/feeling-of-something-waiting-there-for-you/\">Robin Sloan&rsquo;s excellent newsletter</a>. I&rsquo;m only ~50 pages in and it&rsquo;s great — pragmatic, concise and non-dogmatic. I&rsquo;ve found the quotes are particularly helpful — the writing is brilliant, and from writers with diverse styles, working across fiction, non-fiction and journalism. It&rsquo;s a good book to dip in and out of and will likely find a place next to my desk.</li>\n<li>We needed to shoot Baby T&rsquo;s passport photo, so of course I made a palaver of it. Most of our friends resorted to laying their babies on a sheet, but had to live with creases galore. I scoured the flat for a suitable white background and then realised I had the perfect solution — the large, minimally branded box for my Apple Studio Display. I placed baby over the branding, et voilà, studio quality white background&hellip; For simplicity&rsquo;s sake I bounced a speed light off a white wall (plus a little of the ceiling), with the monitor box perpendicular to the wall. Was a nice soft light, if in retrospect a little too &lsquo;toppy&rsquo;. I should have moved the box further from the wall and aimed the light at where the wall meets the ceiling. It was much improved by my wife holding some silver card to lift the shadows and provide a second catchlight.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<ul>\n<li>Shot at Wimbledon at an editorial x commercial crossover. Small group of VIPs so not much to cover. It was raining throughout, but the balcony had a large roof over it which shaped the light nicely. The roof blocked the top light, which prevented the &lsquo;panda-eyes&rsquo; look you get on an overcast day, resulting in beautiful soft light that wrapped around the subjects. Shot some nice safety portraits first, then made the best of the spotlights in the hospitality suite. When the key group disappeared in the middle of the day to watch the action, I started in on the edit and had most of the first pass finished before they returned.</li>\n<li>Shot a set of lifestyle marketing images for a startup. Their office was the uninspiring first location, but with a little light, some plant rearrangement and judicious use of shallow depth of field, we transformed a small corner of it into an aspirational apartment. We also squeezed a studio set-up and a &lsquo;gallery&rsquo; out of the same end of the room. I hired in a few of the more powerful <a href=\"https://www.aputure.com/\">Aputure</a> COB LED lights so that I could try before I potentially buy. We used the <a href=\"https://www.aputure.com/products/ls-1200d-pro/\">1600D Pro</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.aputure.com/products/ls-600d-pro/\">600D Pro</a>, alongside my <a href=\"https://www.aputure.com/products/ls-300d-ii/\">300D II</a> and smaller <a href=\"https://uk.zhiyun-tech.com/collections/photography-light\">Zhiyun</a> lights. I hired the 1600D to test a higher powered COB fixture, but as we were blending our lights with indirect daylight, we used it below 15% power all day. If the location at been close enough to street level to put it through the window, it would have been a different story: I&rsquo;d have unleashed some fake sun onto the fake plants. The 1600D Pro and soon to be released <a href=\"https://www.aputure.com/products/electro-storm-xt26/\">Electro Storm XT26</a> are the embodiment of my dream lights from a decade ago. Lights that run cold, are nearly equivalent to 2.5k and 4k HMIs in output, and are a fraction of the weight, cost and power draw. I think that there is probably a 600D Pro in my future, or maybe a 600X for ease of blending with artificial light. The RGBWW versions look interesting, but I <a href=\"https://youtu.be/5U-F7EhLp7g\">recently learned from a Youtube video</a> that you get more colour information when you gel a daylight lamp, than if you use an RGBWW fixture to create the same colour directly.

Often I use a medium soft source (umbrella or bounced light) near the camera or available light for speed and simplicity.

There is another woman laughing at the left hand edge of frame\">\n\n- I shot at the Serpentine summer do. It vies with the V&A for the coolest June art party, and for my money has the edge. Great guest list and nice flat, bright light. Lots of good combos and funny interactions (turns out that Paul Smith and Orlando Bloom are BFFs).  Fun evening all around: I took some nice pictures, caught up with a few friends and talked to a pop star about kombucha. Great music later on too. \n- [Craig Mod's](https://craigmod.com/) pop-up newsletter [Basie! Bop! Jamaica!](https://craigmod.com/ridgeline/165/) blew me away. He travelled to 16+ jazz kissas in Japan's smaller cities, then wrote a multi-thousand word essay about each venue and released them day by day on the trip. Oh, and he also documented every one of them with stills, video and audio recordings... It would be a staggering feat of creative endurance regardless, but to top it off the writing is _excellent_. He captures the personalities of the owners, talks about the history of jazz in Japan and American, the qualities of the music and performers, nerds out over the sound systems, and finally weaves it all together with personal experience and socio-political commentary on contemporary culture. It's an improv masterpiece. \n- Off the back of Craig Mod's series I've been listening to a lot of the jazz albums that came up, like Chick Corea's [_Return to Forever_](https://open.spotify.com/album/6M0IAJHwQ6dFNtTkFsXCJc?si=o2V2oY35TlelNCxwQPMQHw)  and Ryo Fukui's [_Scenery_](https://open.spotify.com/album/5Uny0mkKiVGDat7H6SNDyS?si=G6agtx4gTfaGuxiPn2feQQ), along with some old favourites of mine: [_A Love Supreme_](https://open.spotify.com/album/7Eoz7hJvaX1eFkbpQxC5PA?si=XUSKFYYUTs6LbI63-uWJrg), [_Sunday at the Village Vanguard_](https://open.spotify.com/album/3uwufR7PwniMX7t3v4I5oB?si=V3GPHLk6SLyzuPiV4ZUVHw), [_The Köln Concert_](https://open.spotify.com/album/0I8vpSE1bSmysN2PhmHoQg?si=5IPdEJqrS32n-yeaz1b1ug), [_Kind of Blue_](https://open.spotify.com/album/1weenld61qoidwYuZ1GESA?si=tdrpxnxITaSUcEKO7w4gGg) and more.\n- I've been experimenting with [Imagen AI](https://imagen-ai.com/product/) to speed up the process of grading selects from large documentary or event shoots. When I'm in control of the light and using manual settings for e.g. a portrait, it's easy to copy and paste styles across batches of images. However, on reportage-style shoots, the lighting conditions are unique to each image, so that approach doesn't work. Often I'm using aperture priority and riding the exposure compensations dial, so the settings are inconsistent shot-to-shot. That means I have to tweak the brightness, contrast, and colour individually on 250–500 selects. And that is before I make use masks to make local corrections. I've sped up with practice, and can finesse about a picture a minute, but that still adds up to hours of computer time. I've used Imagen to create a custom AI profile trained on 3000+ of my pictures. I finish my edit, select the Lightroom catalogue within Imagen, choose the correct filters to bring up my edit and then upload them to the service. The magic grading pixies work their magic, they send me a notification when they're done, and then I download my edits. They aren't good enough to release — but I'd say that they get me 80-90% there depending on the image. I need to tweak every second or third pic for brightness or white balance and apply any masks that I want to shape the light. I estimate that it's saving me at least two to three hours on every grade, which is a huge quality of life improvement. I particularly like that you re-upload your final edits to refine the model's understanding of your preferences. I've nearly uploaded 6000 images, at which point they fine-tune your model, which according to Reddit is when it noticeably increases in power and usefulness. I'll see how my profile changes post fine-tuning and assess how the cost adds up, but I think it's likely to become a full time part of my process. They are releasing a beta version of a tool that is supposed to help with culling which I will play with, but I have had very mixed results with similar AI tools in the past. Generally they are great at identifying blinks or missed focussed, but bad at distinguishing between subtle facial expressions or gestures that mark out a great picture from a good one. \n\n<img src=\"https://oliverholms.micro.blog/uploads/2023/oliverholms-griii-r018357.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" alt=\"black and white picture of a plant next to a window. Most of the plant is dark and two leaves are lit up. There is a round mirror in the background\">\n\n- Messed around with [Pi AI](https://pi.ai/talk). It's an AI powered chatbot that you can talk to with a dedicated app, or in WhatsApp, Facebook, or Instagram DMs. It's interesting, in that it seems to parse meaning well and reply with useful information. Apart from the slightly formulaic responses, it does feel a lot like talking to a person. I asked it questions about creative programming for generative art and got a nice steer on a good language for beginners and resources to get me started. It also gave me some good jumping off points for exploring the tracker music production workflow with a [Dirtywave M8](https://dirtywave.com/). Judging from the Discord, a lot of people are using it as a sounding board for creative ideas, to talk about philosophy and other 'big questions' or as a journalling / talk therapy aid. I can imagine that it would be good to talk you down if you are spinning out as it has a very calming and friendly conversational style. Over the summer, I want to go deeper on the newly available AI tools to see how I can use them to aid my creative practice. \n- Started [_The Man from The Future_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58857438-the-man-from-the-future), a book about [John von Neumann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann). I listened to a brilliant podcast with the author which made me want to delve deeper into the life of this seemingly extraordinary man. [It was a while ago, but I think that it was this one](https://www.infiniteloopspodcast.com/ananyo-bhattacharya-john-von-neumann-the-man-from-the-future-ep151/). In honesty, I hadn't heard of him until a few years ago, when a physicist on a podcast declared that von Neumann was far and away the smartest person he had ever meet. Learning that this physicist also used to know Einstein made me really sit up and take notice. Who was this man whose genius outshone one of the most famous brains in history? Most impressive is the sheer breadth of his contributions: game theory, mathematics, quantum mechanics, nuclear physics, ballistics, cellular automata, early computing, and much more. A lot of his discoveries laid the groundwork for the most important technologies shaping the present. Here's [another interesting podcast with the author](https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/p/ananyo-bhattacharya#details) that I listened to this week.\n- I also started [_Writing Tools_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41812861-writing-tools) by Roy Peter Clark, after a recommendation in [Robin Sloan's excellent newsletter](https://www.robinsloan.com/newsletters/feeling-of-something-waiting-there-for-you/). I'm only ~50 pages in and it's great — pragmatic, concise and non-dogmatic. I've found the quotes are particularly helpful — the writing is brilliant, and from writers with diverse styles, working across fiction, non-fiction and journalism. It's a good book to dip in and out of and will likely find a place next to my desk.\n- We needed to shoot Baby T's passport photo, so of course I made a palaver of it. Most of our friends resorted to laying their babies on a sheet, but had to live with creases galore. I scoured the flat for a suitable white background and then realised I had the perfect solution — the large, minimally branded box for my Apple Studio Display. I placed baby over the branding, et voilà, studio quality white background... For simplicity's sake I bounced a speed light off a white wall (plus a little of the ceiling), with the monitor box perpendicular to the wall. Was a nice soft light, if in retrospect a little too 'toppy'. I should have moved the box further from the wall and aimed the light at where the wall meets the ceiling. It was much improved by my wife holding some silver card to lift the shadows and provide a second catchlight.  \n\n<img src=\"https://oliverholms.micro.blog/uploads/2023/oliverholms-griii-r018375.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"900\" alt=\"Woman sitting on a green sofa with her left arm held up.

It was raining throughout, but the balcony had a large roof over it which shaped the light nicely. The roof blocked the top light, which prevented the 'panda-eyes' look you get on an overcast day, resulting in beautiful soft light that wrapped around the subjects. Shot some nice safety portraits first, then made the best of the spotlights in the hospitality suite. When the key group disappeared in the middle of the day to watch the action, I started in on the edit and had most of the first pass finished before they returned.    \n- Shot a set of lifestyle marketing images for a startup. Their office was the uninspiring first location, but with a little light, some plant rearrangement and judicious use of shallow depth of field, we transformed a small corner of it into an aspirational apartment. We also squeezed a studio set-up and a 'gallery' out of the same end of the room. I hired in a few of the more powerful [Aputure](https://www.aputure.com/) COB LED lights so that I could try before I potentially buy. We used the [1600D Pro](https://www.aputure.com/products/ls-1200d-pro/) and the [600D Pro](https://www.aputure.com/products/ls-600d-pro/), alongside my [300D II](https://www.aputure.com/products/ls-300d-ii/) and smaller [Zhiyun](https://uk.zhiyun-tech.com/collections/photography-light) lights. I hired the 1600D to test a higher powered COB fixture, but as we were blending our lights with indirect daylight, we used it below 15% power all day. If the location at been close enough to street level to put it through the window, it would have been a different story: I'd have unleashed some fake sun onto the fake plants. The 1600D Pro and soon to be released [Electro Storm XT26](https://www.aputure.com/products/electro-storm-xt26/) are the embodiment of my dream lights from a decade ago. Lights that run cold, are nearly equivalent to 2.5k and 4k HMIs in output, and are a fraction of the weight, cost and power draw. I think that there is probably a 600D Pro in my future, or maybe a 600X for ease of blending with artificial light. The RGBWW versions look interesting, but I [recently learned from a Youtube video](https://youtu.be/5U-F7EhLp7g) that you get more colour information when you gel a daylight lamp, than if you use an RGBWW fixture to create the same colour directly. That means that I'm more likely to invest in daylight-balanced or bi-colour lights for maximum power output and gel them as required. \n- Aside from the geeky specifics mentioned above, it was really nice to shoot something where I had the time (and an excellent assistant) to light each scene properly. It's fun to nerd out about subtle nuances of bounced light, fake daylight and optimal shadows.  Normally, I might only have three to five minutes with a portrait subject, ten max, so the focus is on making sure that the lighting is functional, flattering and reliable. Often I use a medium soft source (umbrella or bounced light) near the camera or available light for speed and simplicity. It's a case of getting the shot in the bag, not lighting the shot as beautifully as possible, with all the subtleties that would require. \n- I discovered the [Gaffer and Gear](https://www.youtube.com/@gaffergear/videos) Youtube channel when looking for reviews of the Aperture lights and have been obsessively watched older videos.

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p><em>Another set of week notes bundled for your reading (dis)pleasure&hellip;</em></p>\n<p>I don’t think it’s worth accounting for the time week by week. The late nights, tens of thousands of images and numerous shoots of the last few weeks blurred into one amorphous endurance event. This isn&rsquo;t comprehensive (I can&rsquo;t talk about some of the projects), instead it&rsquo;s a selection of takeaways and things that I want to experiment with or think about more in the future.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I started with four evening shoots split between two venues. The four events were split into two pairs, with different guests at each, but following a nearly identical format. Welcome drinks on the first day at venue one and then a black tie gala dinner on the second day at venue two. It was both challenging and interesting to work through the déjà vu of shooting essentially the same job twice in the same week. Each evening I had to find new angles and approaches to keep the pictures fresh and my attention sharp. On the other hand, I could review the pictures from the first pair of days, then go into the second half of the project knowing where I messed up, what I over and under shot, where the light would be at a certain time, and how people would interact with the spaces.</li>\n<li>To a certain extent this is the kind post mortem I run after every shoot: What worked? What didn’t? Did I need more depth of field for the tight shots? What would have been a better shutter speed / ISO trade-off? Should I have asked for more portraits or prioritised candid moments? However, it’s rare that the review ⮂ shoot cycle is so short, and even rarer that I can apply what I’ve learned to an almost exact replica of the situation where I learned it.</li>\n<li>I enjoyed the scope of this project — in one evening I shot the scenography and spaces, documentary pics of guests, details of the food, two fashion shows, beauty shots of models wearing jewellery, a performance by a pop megastar, night time architectural shots of the venue’s exterior and a dimly lit after party. Despite being snobbish about photographing at events initially, it&rsquo;s honed and diversified my skills more than any other photography genre. It&rsquo;s taught me how to cover a variety of subjects quickly and effectively, even when I have little to no control of the situation.</li>\n<li>I shot two projects at the newly reopened National Portrait Gallery and one at the National Gallery. Having also shot at Tate Britain a few weeks prior, I can say that the light for ambient photography at some of London’s premier galleries is <em>terrible</em>. Legions of spotlights and high ceilings are a recipe for burned out highlights, panda eye shadows and luminous noses — a visual dish that is deeply unpalatable to me. I’m comfortable shooting in very low light situations, scenes lit only my candle light or a handful of lanterns for example, but straight-up <em>ugly</em> light is hard to deal with. The National Gallery is by far the worst in this respect. Not only does the light veer between harsh and sludgy, the main rooms are also incredibly dark.</li>\n<li>I had to be discreet on the first shoot at NPG, so I crossed my fingers, underexposed to save the highlights and boosted the shadows massively in post. (Sometimes using specific masks on hero shots to bring out faces.) For the second NPG shoot and the National Gallery shoot I decided to renege on my vow of purity and add a speedlight to my wide angle camera. I kept the longer lens free for ambient light images, and switched between them as the situation dictated. At the National Gallery, that meant getting safety shots/full lengths with flash and then shooting some super shallow DoF ambient portraits when in areas with nicer light. Despite the obvious differences in sharpness and directionality, the flash images integrated quite nicely with the other pictures. It helped that I shot it at a higher ISO, gelled the flash to tungsten, and used a wider f stop (f2–f2.8) and a slow shutter speed (1/15s–1/60s to mix in the ambient light) to mimic images shot in low light.</li>\n<li>I still don&rsquo;t have a lighting solution that I&rsquo;m happy with when shooting impromptu portraits or reportage in shitty light. I need to experiment more with flash on camera, to work out how I can integrate it into my style of shooting. I dislike how a speedlight makes me very obvious when shooting candid pictures. (I prefer to take the picture and move on without the subject even noticing.) My work camera + flash combo is large and cumbersome, and as soon as I take the first image, I announce my presence, changing the scene. For portraits it’s not so bad as I’m not in stealth mode. However, it worries me that I can’t see what I’m going to get through the viewfinder especially when I need to work quickly. I don&rsquo;t want to hit playback to check that I got the picture, I want to see the light in the viewfinder before I trip the shutter.</li>\n<li>I’ve found TTL unreliable recently — I get two or three perfect shots and then a completely different lighting balance on next few images. I&rsquo;m scared that I could shoot 5–10 pics of a VIP, then check the camera to find that the results are a dog’s dinner and I’ve lost my opportunity. I’m going to start experimenting with manual flash for consistency. My working distances are usually quite controlled and I can work out sensible defaults for a full length, landscape two-shot and a close-up. I’ve been practising this with my Ricoh GR III + LightPix Labs FlashQ Q20II with good results. This is my Goldilocks set-up for non-work parties — the camera is designed for one-handed operation and the flash has a tiny detachable transmitter for off-camera work. It doesn’t hurt that it’s a cute combo that people find funny&hellip; Particularly when I pop up in praying mantis stance, camera in one hand, flash held aloft in the other, grinning ear to ear. I’ve started carrying the GR in one pocket and the flash in the other on work shoots too, so that I can grab a quick hard flash shot when the opportunity presents itself. I used to hate the flash-on-camera look when I was younger but it&rsquo;s really grown on me. I like projects where the photographer mixes photos using beautiful natural light with saturated hard flash pictures.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<ul>\n<li>I’m also looking into small continuous lighting options like the amazing new mini COB lights by Zhiyun — the <a href=\"https://www.zhiyun-tech.com/en/product/detail/768\">MOLUS X100</a> and <a href=\"https://www.zhiyun-tech.com/en/product/detail/757?type=website&amp;page=product_weebill&amp;source=list&amp;title=MOLUS%20G60\">MOLUS G60</a>. I love the idea of that much light from such a small package, coupled with a small hard source and enough battery to run for a while on low to medium power settings. Reviews are a little thin on the ground, so I might have to buy one to try out. I sometimes work alongside a great French celebrity portrait photographer. When he is shooting portraits at an event, he moves through the crowd with an assistant who carries a Profoto B10X on a pole. They locate their subject, the assistant lights them up using the flash&rsquo;s modelling light through a mini-softbox and the photographer gets the pic on his medium format Fuji set-up. This approach allows him to work in chaotic and dark environments using a high resolution camera that would otherwise suffer in those conditions. I want something more minimal and inconspicuous than their gear; maybe something that I can hold myself, or light enough to clamp to furniture and bounce off the ceiling in hotel rooms/small venues. Still the idea is solid and I love continuous light, particularly if it’s a situation where I won&rsquo;t have much time, control or second chances.</li>\n<li>I bought a new screen, my first in more than a decade, after it became impossible to calibrate my ancient Eizo CG234W with due to a software / operating system conflict. I went for the Apple Studio Display as I wanted something that would integrate with my all-Mac ecosystem without fuss. Gaining three new USB-C ports and the ability to charge my laptop via the screen are a bonus too. I bought a reconditioned VESA mount version so I can use a monitor arm to free up desk space. I needed to get down to work immediately, so I bolted its beautifully machined chassis onto the <em>fugly</em> grey plastic stand I salvaged from my Eizo. (<em>Shudder</em>) So far the screen is excellent — the extra resolution makes it much easier to assess how sharp a picture is and see people&rsquo;s faces clearly in a group shot. The reflections on my standard glossy version are a little annoying (the window is behind me in my office). However, when editing/grading I like to work in what my wife and I affectionately call ‘The Cave’ — a sensory deprivation environment created by closing the blinds, turning off the lights and wearing noise cancelling headphones. In the gloom of The Cave, the reflections disappear; and when I’m not working on photography stuff, the reflections don’t bother me much.</li>\n<li>I had a last minute shoot at Ascot called in the night before. I scrambled to find a morning suit at 2100. I lucked out — my wife’s friend who lives 20mins away had one. Clearly, he has much fancier friends than me. I have a few suits and black tie on hand for various dress codes, but I draw the line at having a top hat on the kit shelf&hellip;</li>\n<li>I’ve shot at Ascot a few times and it never ceases to bemuse.

It is lit with warm light, there are candles on the steps and a line of cars waiting to pick up guests.\">\n\n_Another set of week notes bundled for your reading (dis)pleasure..._\n\nI don’t think it’s worth accounting for the time week by week. The late nights, tens of thousands of images and numerous shoots of the last few weeks blurred into one amorphous endurance event. This isn't comprehensive (I can't talk about some of the projects), instead it's a selection of takeaways and things that I want to experiment with or think about more in the future.\n\n- I started with four evening shoots split between two venues. The four events were split into two pairs, with different guests at each, but following a nearly identical format. Welcome drinks on the first day at venue one and then a black tie gala dinner on the second day at venue two. It was both challenging and interesting to work through the déjà vu of shooting essentially the same job twice in the same week. Each evening I had to find new angles and approaches to keep the pictures fresh and my attention sharp. On the other hand, I could review the pictures from the first pair of days, then go into the second half of the project knowing where I messed up, what I over and under shot, where the light would be at a certain time, and how people would interact with the spaces. \n- To a certain extent this is the kind post mortem I run after every shoot: What worked? What didn’t? Did I need more depth of field for the tight shots? What would have been a better shutter speed / ISO trade-off? Should I have asked for more portraits or prioritised candid moments? However, it’s rare that the review ⮂ shoot cycle is so short, and even rarer that I can apply what I’ve learned to an almost exact replica of the situation where I learned it. \n- I enjoyed the scope of this project — in one evening I shot the scenography and spaces, documentary pics of guests, details of the food, two fashion shows, beauty shots of models wearing jewellery, a performance by a pop megastar, night time architectural shots of the venue’s exterior and a dimly lit after party. Despite being snobbish about photographing at events initially, it's honed and diversified my skills more than any other photography genre. It's taught me how to cover a variety of subjects quickly and effectively, even when I have little to no control of the situation.  \n- I shot two projects at the newly reopened National Portrait Gallery and one at the National Gallery. Having also shot at Tate Britain a few weeks prior, I can say that the light for ambient photography at some of London’s premier galleries is _terrible_. Legions of spotlights and high ceilings are a recipe for burned out highlights, panda eye shadows and luminous noses — a visual dish that is deeply unpalatable to me. I’m comfortable shooting in very low light situations, scenes lit only my candle light or a handful of lanterns for example, but straight-up _ugly_ light is hard to deal with. The National Gallery is by far the worst in this respect. Not only does the light veer between harsh and sludgy, the main rooms are also incredibly dark. \n- I had to be discreet on the first shoot at NPG, so I crossed my fingers, underexposed to save the highlights and boosted the shadows massively in post. (Sometimes using specific masks on hero shots to bring out faces.) For the second NPG shoot and the National Gallery shoot I decided to renege on my vow of purity and add a speedlight to my wide angle camera. I kept the longer lens free for ambient light images, and switched between them as the situation dictated. At the National Gallery, that meant getting safety shots/full lengths with flash and then shooting some super shallow DoF ambient portraits when in areas with nicer light. Despite the obvious differences in sharpness and directionality, the flash images integrated quite nicely with the other pictures. It helped that I shot it at a higher ISO, gelled the flash to tungsten, and used a wider f stop (f2–f2.8) and a slow shutter speed (1/15s–1/60s to mix in the ambient light) to mimic images shot in low light.\n- I still don't have a lighting solution that I'm happy with when shooting impromptu portraits or reportage in shitty light. I need to experiment more with flash on camera, to work out how I can integrate it into my style of shooting. I dislike how a speedlight makes me very obvious when shooting candid pictures. (I prefer to take the picture and move on without the subject even noticing.) My work camera + flash combo is large and cumbersome, and as soon as I take the first image, I announce my presence, changing the scene. For portraits it’s not so bad as I’m not in stealth mode. However, it worries me that I can’t see what I’m going to get through the viewfinder especially when I need to work quickly. I don't want to hit playback to check that I got the picture, I want to see the light in the viewfinder before I trip the shutter. \n- I’ve found TTL unreliable recently — I get two or three perfect shots and then a completely different lighting balance on next few images. I'm scared that I could shoot 5–10 pics of a VIP, then check the camera to find that the results are a dog’s dinner and I’ve lost my opportunity. I’m going to start experimenting with manual flash for consistency. My working distances are usually quite controlled and I can work out sensible defaults for a full length, landscape two-shot and a close-up. I’ve been practising this with my Ricoh GR III + LightPix Labs FlashQ Q20II with good results. This is my Goldilocks set-up for non-work parties — the camera is designed for one-handed operation and the flash has a tiny detachable transmitter for off-camera work. It doesn’t hurt that it’s a cute combo that people find funny... Particularly when I pop up in praying mantis stance, camera in one hand, flash held aloft in the other, grinning ear to ear. I’ve started carrying the GR in one pocket and the flash in the other on work shoots too, so that I can grab a quick hard flash shot when the opportunity presents itself. I used to hate the flash-on-camera look when I was younger but it's really grown on me. I like projects where the photographer mixes photos using beautiful natural light with saturated hard flash pictures. \n  \n<img src=\"https://oliverholms.micro.blog/uploads/2023/oliver-preying-mantis-gr-flash-rivoli.jpeg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" alt=\"Oliver Holms holding up a Ricoh GRIII in his right hand and LightPix Labs FlashQ Q20II in his left hand. He has long brown hair, is wearing a dark green jacket and is smiling to the camera\">\n\n- I’m also looking into small continuous lighting options like the amazing new mini COB lights by Zhiyun — the [MOLUS X100](https://www.zhiyun-tech.com/en/product/detail/768) and [MOLUS G60](https://www.zhiyun-tech.com/en/product/detail/757?type=website&page=product_weebill&source=list&title=MOLUS%20G60). I love the idea of that much light from such a small package, coupled with a small hard source and enough battery to run for a while on low to medium power settings. Reviews are a little thin on the ground, so I might have to buy one to try out. I sometimes work alongside a great French celebrity portrait photographer. When he is shooting portraits at an event, he moves through the crowd with an assistant who carries a Profoto B10X on a pole. They locate their subject, the assistant lights them up using the flash's modelling light through a mini-softbox and the photographer gets the pic on his medium format Fuji set-up. This approach allows him to work in chaotic and dark environments using a high resolution camera that would otherwise suffer in those conditions. I want something more minimal and inconspicuous than their gear; maybe something that I can hold myself, or light enough to clamp to furniture and bounce off the ceiling in hotel rooms/small venues. Still the idea is solid and I love continuous light, particularly if it’s a situation where I won't have much time, control or second chances.\n- I bought a new screen, my first in more than a decade, after it became impossible to calibrate my ancient Eizo CG234W with due to a software / operating system conflict. I went for the Apple Studio Display as I wanted something that would integrate with my all-Mac ecosystem without fuss. Gaining three new USB-C ports and the ability to charge my laptop via the screen are a bonus too. I bought a reconditioned VESA mount version so I can use a monitor arm to free up desk space. I needed to get down to work immediately, so I bolted its beautifully machined chassis onto the _fugly_ grey plastic stand I salvaged from my Eizo. (_Shudder_) So far the screen is excellent — the extra resolution makes it much easier to assess how sharp a picture is and see people's faces clearly in a group shot. The reflections on my standard glossy version are a little annoying (the window is behind me in my office). However, when editing/grading I like to work in what my wife and I affectionately call ‘The Cave’ — a sensory deprivation environment created by closing the blinds, turning off the lights and wearing noise cancelling headphones. In the gloom of The Cave, the reflections disappear; and when I’m not working on photography stuff, the reflections don’t bother me much. \n- I had a last minute shoot at Ascot called in the night before. I scrambled to find a morning suit at 2100. I lucked out — my wife’s friend who lives 20mins away had one. Clearly, he has much fancier friends than me. I have a few suits and black tie on hand for various dress codes, but I draw the line at having a top hat on the kit shelf...\n- I’ve shot at Ascot a few times and it never ceases to bemuse. It's a such a strange mix of people, drawn together to have parallel but distinct experiences. It's a playground for memetic desire. Everyone is aspiring, but in different directions, following different blueprints. Perhaps one year, I’ll get a press pass and attend to shoot street-style without the strictures of a commission? I want to read [Wanting](https://lukeburgis.com/wanting) by Luke Burgis too, his book on [René Girard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Girard) and mimesis as I enjoyed his [interview on The Knowledge Project](https://youtu.be/gMlxnW02Kxs). \n- This has been nearly a month of complete work life imbalance — if I wasn’t shooting, I was editing at my desk until 0000–0430.

Like with a lot of weekend activities, it's a destination that gives you an excuse to walk and talk, and then walk back again. \n\n<img src=\"https://oliverholms.micro.blog/uploads/2023/oliverholms-griii-r017884.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" alt=\"Back lit reeds in a dusty pond, covered in pollen from the trees that surround the pool\">\n\n## Reading\n[10 Thoughts From the Fourth Trimester - Wait But Why](https://waitbutwhy.com/2023/05/baby.html) Our kids were born days apart and he nails the feeling of the first few weeks with a newborn.\n\n[What Photography Has Taught Me About Music](https://andrewtasselmyer.substack.com/p/what-photography-has-taught-me-about) via [Duncan Geere](https://buttondown.email/duncangeere)\n\n[24-Hour Black Screen YouTube Videos](https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/28/23738957/youtube-videos-24-hours-blank-screen) — A fun dive into a genre of Youtube videos that I new nothing about.\n\n## Listening\n\n[Dr Andy Galpin: How to Build Strength, Muscle Size, and Endurance  — Huberman Lab](overcast.fm/+2-B-kEE_c)\n\n<img src=\"https://oliverholms.micro.blog/uploads/2023/oliverholms-griii-r017945.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" alt=\"View through a large wooden sculpture by Ai Wei Wei in side a gallery.

Lots of last minute changes and mountains of emails. \n- had a lovely weekend day out to celebrate my wife's birthday early. My shoot the following week sandwiched her birthday and I knew that the edit deadlines would make it hard to do anything fun on the day. We went to the brilliant [Ai Wei Wei exhibition](https://designmuseum.org/exhibitions/ai-weiwei-making-sense)  at Design Museum. Wei Wei is one of my favourite conceptual artists — unlike many he combines powerful ideas with a strong visual aesthetic. A lot of conceptual work falls flat for me because the artist forgets to make it interesting to look at or experience. I don't want to be told why something is good or thought provoking, I want the work's form, content and presentation to encourage discovery and conversation. Also, the exhibition was one of my favourite things — a one room show... There was this incredible density of visual interest and meaning to be deciphered in the space — each of the pieces talking to and presented in relationship to all the others. The only downside was a Gallery Bore, who was expounding loudly about What It All Meant to his date. We had to strategically navigate the space to stay out of earshot. \n- Nice collection of work by and that inspires [Yinka Ilori](https://yinkailori.com/) on the first floor balcony too.\n- We went for a brilliant lunch at [Akub](https://goo.gl/maps/AzuFb4pwT4byivJS7), a Mediterranean restaurant in Notting Hill after the gallery. The food was delicious and presented beautifully, but without fuss. We sat upstairs under the skylight and felt like we were on holiday. \n- I'm sure other things happened during the week but I was swimming so hard to stay afloat in  the email ocean, that I've blanked out everything else.\n\n <img src=\"https://oliverholms.micro.blog/uploads/2023/oliverholms-griii-r017921.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" alt=\"baby's face, mostly hidden by the back of an adult's arm.

I loved the way he presented the prints without frames, mosaic-style, playing with scale and juxtaposition. I massively overshot, given the magazines needs (~12 pictures), but the extra coverage helped with the tricky lighting conditions. Due to bad planning / mixed messages about deadlines / desire to work when the flat was quiet, I worked late on both the on-the-night preview edit (0200) and then the final grade a few days later (0400). I love working in the early hours as I feel so peaceful and focussed, but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a good long-term solution to distracted days. I get a huge amount done, particularly on projects I&rsquo;ve been putting off, but it pushes my clock around, leading to a cycle of late waking and late working that getting more and more extreme. I often wish I was one of those larks who can jump out of bed at 0500 and get 3 hours of creative work in before the world wakes up.</li>\n<li>I really enjoyed <em>My Life as a Courgette</em>, a beautifully animated film set in a children&rsquo;s home. It&rsquo;s dark, funny, and philosophical, with an ease that is inimitably French. It doesn&rsquo;t shy away from tough subjects but never slips into lazy pessimism or unrelenting bleakness. The visuals are a treat, with great attention paid to gesture that reveals character. I loved the styling of the vehicles, with their boxy, low-slung silhouettes and tiny wheels.</li>\n<li>On Friday, I walked past a small crew taking pictures of a model against the wall of my block. I thought that the background was a bit dull (photo snob!), so I invited them into the building to take pictures from the top-floor walkway and interior staircases. They had come to London from Japan to shoot for their <a href=\"https://instagram.com/rurumu.official?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=\">fashion brand</a>. <a href=\"https://instagram.com/aoitoh\">The photographer</a> had studied at LCF (or maybe somewhere else?) so she knew London well. I grabbed a quick pic of them, directed them to a few nice spots, and left them to explore.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<h2 id=\"we-7-may\">W/E 7 May</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>First trip out of London with baby last week — to the South Coast near Rye to visit my mum. Worked over the weekend before so that I could relax (hence no weeknotes). The day we left was particularly stressful. I worked until 0400 the night before to finish an edit. Then I spent the next morning locating every picture from my old site in my archive to export out in high res for my new site to upload while away. Of course, I did nothing of the sort. Time just dissolved into the aether throughout the week&hellip; It wasn&rsquo;t totally in vain though. Going away was exactly the kind of artificial deadline that I needed to stop procrastinating and get on with the one thing that had been holding up work on the site for weeks.</li>\n<li>The trip was good, with mostly pleasant weather. Baby T gained a new nickname, Yuri, as she looked like a little cosmonaut in her car seat. We walked at an acute angle into strong winds on Camber Beach. We visited friends and had a tour of their House of Many Staircases. I ate veggie pasties and we drank all the drinks at the new cafe on Rye Nature Reserve. We marvelled at the wild orchids, tulips, and mega fennel at Great Dixter. We graciously accepted any and all compliments directed at our Cute Baby. We ate excellent pizza (while standing up and soothing T) at bucolic hipster paradise, Tillingham. We were mildly devastated to arrive at The Fish Shack at Dungeness to find them out of their famed fried potatoes. We drove home. We accept that this chronology is deeply garbled.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<ul>\n<li>Back to London to shoot street pictures around the Coronation. I&rsquo;d hired a Leica M10-R to trial over the long weekend. I&rsquo;ve been obsessing over the idea of buying a Leica digital rangefinder for a while now, but I wanted to try one out to avoid a <em>very</em> expensive mistake. The last film camera that I used was an M6 TTL, so it&rsquo;s a way of working that I&rsquo;m familiar with and enjoy, but I didn&rsquo;t know if my desire to re-adopt that approach was pure nostalgia or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shopping_addiction#Gear_Acquisition_Syndrome_(G.A.S.)\">G.A.S.</a>. In any event, I picked it up on the Saturday morning from Leica Mayfair and then headed further south in search of action. I was a bit nervous at the prospect of taking a multi-thousand-pound camera and lens out into the soggy conditions, but my worries were soothed by the Leica rep. He said that the only reason they can&rsquo;t call the camera weather-sealed is because there is no gasket to seal the lens mount and that they are otherwise pretty hardy. I still made an effort to keep the camera out of the worst of the weather and wiped it down regularly like Macbeth trying to wash his hands of imagined blood.</li>\n<li>The M10-R held up brilliantly in the rain and I enjoyed working in the rangefinder mode again. I love the RF viewfinder experience — you can see the action around the frame and there&rsquo;s no mirror black-out to hide the moment that you captured. I also love the physical skills and mental acuity required to shoot with the camera — no AF, manual/range focussing every frame, guessing distances, making decisions about depth-of-field, framing, positioning, and exposure compensation to anticipate the needs of the next picture to present itself to you. It&rsquo;s a very embodied way of working and it&rsquo;s brilliant for sharpening your attention. My only frustration was with the slow start-up time. I was keeping the camera switched off and turning it on to shoot like I do with my X-T4s and GRIII. But the Leica&rsquo;s slightly slower wake-up window meant that I missed a few nice opportunities. I think if I owned one I would just buy more batteries and leave it on while shooting, but as I only had one battery to last all day I had to baby it.</li>\n<li>I shot for a good few hours, before rain and Union Jack-induced burnout hit. I started at a small screening party in Grosvenor Square to get warmed up and get used to the camera. Then I walked down to Green Park, along the marshalled route to Hyde Park, down into the screening area near the Serpentine, then along to Piccadilly, and finally down to Trafalgar Square before wending my way home. I didn&rsquo;t get anything amazing, but I really enjoyed the process and still got a nice set to document the day.</li>\n<li>Bumped into my friend Georgia by Tottenham Court Road tube on the way home. We sat outside a bar, huddled under the table umbrella, and had a catch-up. Then I shot a quick portrait of her at the base of Centre Point.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<ul>\n<li>I tried and failed to organise some more test scenarios for Sun and Monday. I wanted to use the camera in circumstances that reflect my usual working environments and was feeling grumpy and frustrated for not planning further in advance. Imogen sensibly kicked me out of the house on Sunday afternoon to shoot some street stuff to combat the aforementioned grumpiness. I walked into town via Regents Park and picked up my sister on the way. We walked down Portland Place to Oxford Circus and then curved down to Leicester Square via Piccadilly, before walking up to Tottenham Court Road to get the bus home from near Warren Street. I got a nice pic of an older Asian couple in Piccadilly and then one of my better street portraits — a lady and a young boy selling plastic children&rsquo;s toys on the pavement near Goodge Street station. So even though I was bemoaning leaving late and missing the best light, it was still well worth it. The magic of street photography for me is that even if you get nothing but crap you&rsquo;ve still had a good walk and spent a few hours paying closer attention to your surroundings than you would have otherwise.</li>\n<li>On Monday before taking the camera back, I went for a walk around Regents Park with Imogen and T, as well as Imogen&rsquo;s friends and their kids. I&rsquo;d been annoyed that I hadn&rsquo;t had a chance to use the Leica in a documentary situation. But trying to manually focus on two children under 7 years old as they dashed around, rode on shoulders, demanded to be aeroplanes, and bedecked a buggy with picked flowers was the perfect test of whether I was fast enough to work with the M10 in a fast-moving situation. These were some of the nicest pictures of the weekend (and much appreciated). More and more, partially inspired by <a href=\"https://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/2013/08/lest-we-forget.html\">this post</a> on The Online Photographer talking about the photographer&rsquo;s responsibility as a documentarian, I believe that one of the key responsibilities of the photographer is to make pictures that document the lives of you, your family and your friends. Don&rsquo;t sweat the arty shit for a day, forget your worries about &lsquo;authenticity&rsquo;, and release your aspirational desires. Make pictures of the friends, family, cute kids, great dogs, evil cats, and loveable oldies that are woven into your life. Everything is changing all of the time — and everything that you think is integral to your life will be gone forever soon enough.</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<h2 id=\"we-14-may\">W/E 14 May</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>shot a quick job at the beginning of the week. Turned it around in good time. Apart from having very little time to shoot and some tricky mixed lighting, all went smoothly.</li>\n<li>Great day out at Photo London with <a href=\"https://www.mathieuchaze.com/\">Mathieu Chaze</a>. I went for the first time last year (also with Mathew) and I&rsquo;m not sure why I left it so long. Even when most of the work doesn&rsquo;t resonate with me it&rsquo;s a great place to wander around and bump into old friends or legends of the UK photo scene. We had coffee at a table next to <a href=\"https://www.martinparr.com/\">Martin Parr</a> in the morning and in the afternoon I nearly collided with <a href=\"https://instagram.com/julianmarshall.art?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==\">Julian Marshall</a>, a photographer turned painter who I used to assist when I was starting out. It&rsquo;s a shame the weather was crap, as it curtailed the courtyard people-watching that was a big part of the experience last year. Lots of attendees were ostentatiously carrying cameras to let others know that they were <em>phototographers</em>. And to my eye, there were far more Leicas on display than seemed representative of the UK photo community&hellip;</li>\n<li>I saw a lot of individual nice pictures and some beautiful photobooks, but a lot of the work felt either obtuse, derivative, or corporate/cheesy, particularly in the central tent. There were still plenty of black and white &lsquo;fine art&rsquo; nudes of a type that I thought died out in the 70s. High contrast T&amp;A clearly still has a market.</li>\n<li>I&rsquo;d already seen them at COB gallery, but <a href=\"https://www.jackdavison.co.uk/\">Jack Davison</a>&rsquo;s incredible etchings printed from his photos were a highlight for me. I also liked Finnish photographer <a href=\"https://aapohuhta.com/\">Aapo Huhta</a>&rsquo;s project Omatandangole and thought that <a href=\"https://michaelchristopherbrown.com/\">Michael Christopher Brown</a>&rsquo;s post-photography, A.I. &lsquo;reportage&rsquo; project, <a href=\"https://www.airlab.co/90-miles\">90 Miles</a> about the Cuban boat people and the conditions in Cuba that prompted their journey to Florida was a more interesting approach to generative imagery. Too many good single images to mention by name (shout out to insane talent coming out of Japan, <em>as always</em>). On the book front I really liked the light and mood in <a href=\"https://www.kehrerverlag.com/en/kentaro-kumon-nemurushima-the-sleeping-island-978-3-96900-076-2\">Nemurushima (The Sleeping Island) by Kentaro Kumon</a>. It&rsquo;s a series of quiet and contemplative pictures made on a small island that only has a dozen or so residents left. I also liked the <a href=\"https://beyondwords.co.uk/secret-light\">Secret of Light</a> catalogue from a <a href=\"http://www.ralphgibson.com/\">Ralph Gibson</a> retrospective show. (The person manning the store said Gibson found the show a little odd, as it felt like he was already dead). I really like Gibson&rsquo;s moody and surreal B&amp;W work from <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Trilogie-Ralph-Gibson-Gilles-Mora/dp/2754110313\">La Trilogie</a> which is included in Secret of Light. But I enjoyed seeing his new-to-me <a href=\"http://www.ralphgibson.com/2016-the-vertical-horizon.html\">contemporary colour work</a>. It&rsquo;s clean and minimal, and a little uncanny. All the trickery and symbolism of the work I was familiar with is gone, replaced with incisive attention to form and texture.</li>\n<li>Imogen swung by Somerset House with Baby T at in a break within rainstorms for Mathieu to meet our new addition. She slept through the entire process, so it wasn&rsquo;t much more than &lsquo;Look! We made a baby.&rsquo; I made my way home after Mathieu did his signing for his brilliant book <a href=\"https://www.mathieuchaze.com/books/rock-paper-scissors-limited-edition-signed\">Rock, Paper, Scissors</a></li>\n<li>Lovely social weekend. Breakfast with family, then a friend of Imogen&rsquo;s came around in the afternoon for a baby viewing on Saturday. Coffee in perfect sunshine outside Italo in Bonington Square with one of Imogen&rsquo;s authors, then on to Camberwell for an impeccable lunch at Imogen&rsquo;s friend&rsquo;s new flat.

We accept that this chronology is deeply garbled. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://oliverholms.micro.blog/uploads/2023/23bbb43027.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" alt=\"View down the beach at Camber Sands shot from the dunes.

There is an orange flag flying on a white flagpole in the distance in the center-right of the picture, at the edge of the dunes.\" />\r\n\r\n- Back to London to shoot street pictures around the Coronation. I'd hired a Leica M10-R to trial over the long weekend. I've been obsessing over the idea of buying a Leica digital rangefinder for a while now, but I wanted to try one out to avoid a _very_ expensive mistake. The last film camera that I used was an M6 TTL, so it's a way of working that I'm familiar with and enjoy, but I didn't know if my desire to re-adopt that approach was pure nostalgia or [G.A.S.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shopping_addiction#Gear_Acquisition_Syndrome_(G.A.S.)). In any event, I picked it up on the Saturday morning from Leica Mayfair and then headed further south in search of action. I was a bit nervous at the prospect of taking a multi-thousand-pound camera and lens out into the soggy conditions, but my worries were soothed by the Leica rep. He said that the only reason they can't call the camera weather-sealed is because there is no gasket to seal the lens mount and that they are otherwise pretty hardy. I still made an effort to keep the camera out of the worst of the weather and wiped it down regularly like Macbeth trying to wash his hands of imagined blood.\r\n- The M10-R held up brilliantly in the rain and I enjoyed working in the rangefinder mode again. I love the RF viewfinder experience — you can see the action around the frame and there's no mirror black-out to hide the moment that you captured. I also love the physical skills and mental acuity required to shoot with the camera — no AF, manual/range focussing every frame, guessing distances, making decisions about depth-of-field, framing, positioning, and exposure compensation to anticipate the needs of the next picture to present itself to you. It's a very embodied way of working and it's brilliant for sharpening your attention. My only frustration was with the slow start-up time. I was keeping the camera switched off and turning it on to shoot like I do with my X-T4s and GRIII. But the Leica's slightly slower wake-up window meant that I missed a few nice opportunities. I think if I owned one I would just buy more batteries and leave it on while shooting, but as I only had one battery to last all day I had to baby it. \r\n- I shot for a good few hours, before rain and Union Jack-induced burnout hit. I started at a small screening party in Grosvenor Square to get warmed up and get used to the camera. Then I walked down to Green Park, along the marshalled route to Hyde Park, down into the screening area near the Serpentine, then along to Piccadilly, and finally down to Trafalgar Square before wending my way home. I didn't get anything amazing, but I really enjoyed the process and still got a nice set to document the day. \r\n- Bumped into my friend Georgia by Tottenham Court Road tube on the way home. We sat outside a bar, huddled under the table umbrella, and had a catch-up. Then I shot a quick portrait of her at the base of Centre Point.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://oliverholms.micro.blog/uploads/2023/3e2b30046a.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"396\" alt=\"Portrait of actor, Georgia Winters, standing against a grey tiled wall against the base of Centre Point. She is wearing a black jacket and a light grey hoodie, with the hood up.\"  />\r\n\r\n- I tried and failed to organise some more test scenarios for Sun and Monday. I wanted to use the camera in circumstances that reflect my usual working environments and was feeling grumpy and frustrated for not planning further in advance. Imogen sensibly kicked me out of the house on Sunday afternoon to shoot some street stuff to combat the aforementioned grumpiness. I walked into town via Regents Park and picked up my sister on the way. We walked down Portland Place to Oxford Circus and then curved down to Leicester Square via Piccadilly, before walking up to Tottenham Court Road to get the bus home from near Warren Street. I got a nice pic of an older Asian couple in Piccadilly and then one of my better street portraits — a lady and a young boy selling plastic children's toys on the pavement near Goodge Street station. So even though I was bemoaning leaving late and missing the best light, it was still well worth it. The magic of street photography for me is that even if you get nothing but crap you've still had a good walk and spent a few hours paying closer attention to your surroundings than you would have otherwise. \r\n- On Monday before taking the camera back, I went for a walk around Regents Park with Imogen and T, as well as Imogen's friends and their kids. I'd been annoyed that I hadn't had a chance to use the Leica in a documentary situation. But trying to manually focus on two children under 7 years old as they dashed around, rode on shoulders, demanded to be aeroplanes, and bedecked a buggy with picked flowers was the perfect test of whether I was fast enough to work with the M10 in a fast-moving situation. These were some of the nicest pictures of the weekend (and much appreciated). More and more, partially inspired by [this post](https://theonlinephotographer.typepad.com/the_online_photographer/2013/08/lest-we-forget.html) on The Online Photographer talking about the photographer's responsibility as a documentarian, I believe that one of the key responsibilities of the photographer is to make pictures that document the lives of you, your family and your friends. Don't sweat the arty shit for a day, forget your worries about 'authenticity', and release your aspirational desires. Make pictures of the friends, family, cute kids, great dogs, evil cats, and loveable oldies that are woven into your life. Everything is changing all of the time — and everything that you think is integral to your life will be gone forever soon enough. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://oliverholms.micro.blog/uploads/2023/f5a78f6c6b.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"396\" alt=\"small child in a yellow rainsuit waving two small Union Jack flags at the Coronation of Kings Charles celebration in Hyde Park.

There is a younger child in a blue rainsuit to the right, and two adults in red rain gear on the left. There is a large crowd surrounding the main subjects that extends into the distance.\" />\r\n\r\n## W/E 14 May\r\n- shot a quick job at the beginning of the week. Turned it around in good time. Apart from having very little time to shoot and some tricky mixed lighting, all went smoothly.\r\n- Great day out at Photo London with [Mathieu Chaze](https://www.mathieuchaze.com/). I went for the first time last year (also with Mathew) and I'm not sure why I left it so long. Even when most of the work doesn't resonate with me it's a great place to wander around and bump into old friends or legends of the UK photo scene. We had coffee at a table next to [Martin Parr](https://www.martinparr.com/) in the morning and in the afternoon I nearly collided with [Julian Marshall](https://instagram.com/julianmarshall.art?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==), a photographer turned painter who I used to assist when I was starting out. It's a shame the weather was crap, as it curtailed the courtyard people-watching that was a big part of the experience last year. Lots of attendees were ostentatiously carrying cameras to let others know that they were _phototographers_. And to my eye, there were far more Leicas on display than seemed representative of the UK photo community...  \r\n- I saw a lot of individual nice pictures and some beautiful photobooks, but a lot of the work felt either obtuse, derivative, or corporate/cheesy, particularly in the central tent. There were still plenty of black and white 'fine art' nudes of a type that I thought died out in the 70s. High contrast T&A clearly still has a market. \r\n- I'd already seen them at COB gallery, but [Jack Davison](https://www.jackdavison.co.uk/)'s incredible etchings printed from his photos were a highlight for me. I also liked Finnish photographer [Aapo Huhta](https://aapohuhta.com/)'s project Omatandangole and thought that [Michael Christopher Brown](https://michaelchristopherbrown.com/)'s post-photography, A.I. 'reportage' project, [90 Miles](https://www.airlab.co/90-miles) about the Cuban boat people and the conditions in Cuba that prompted their journey to Florida was a more interesting approach to generative imagery. Too many good single images to mention by name (shout out to insane talent coming out of Japan, _as always_). On the book front I really liked the light and mood in [Nemurushima (The Sleeping Island) by Kentaro Kumon](https://www.kehrerverlag.com/en/kentaro-kumon-nemurushima-the-sleeping-island-978-3-96900-076-2). It's a series of quiet and contemplative pictures made on a small island that only has a dozen or so residents left. I also liked the [Secret of Light](https://beyondwords.co.uk/secret-light) catalogue from a [Ralph Gibson](http://www.ralphgibson.com/) retrospective show. (The person manning the store said Gibson found the show a little odd, as it felt like he was already dead). I really like Gibson's moody and surreal B&W work from [La Trilogie](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Trilogie-Ralph-Gibson-Gilles-Mora/dp/2754110313) which is included in Secret of Light. But I enjoyed seeing his new-to-me [contemporary colour work](http://www.ralphgibson.com/2016-the-vertical-horizon.html). It's clean and minimal, and a little uncanny. All the trickery and symbolism of the work I was familiar with is gone, replaced with incisive attention to form and texture. \r\n- Imogen swung by Somerset House with Baby T at in a break within rainstorms for Mathieu to meet our new addition. She slept through the entire process, so it wasn't much more than 'Look! We made a baby.' I made my way home after Mathieu did his signing for his brilliant book [Rock, Paper, Scissors](https://www.mathieuchaze.com/books/rock-paper-scissors-limited-edition-signed)\r\n- Lovely social weekend. Breakfast with family, then a friend of Imogen's came around in the afternoon for a baby viewing on Saturday. Coffee in perfect sunshine outside Italo in Bonington Square with one of Imogen's authors, then on to Camberwell for an impeccable lunch at Imogen's friend's new flat. Light filled and suffused with calm.\r\n\r\n <img src=\"https://oliverholms.micro.blog/uploads/2023/76a1d7ab03.jpg\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\" alt=\"looking up at a narrow staircase running over the center of the frame.

				"content_html": "<p>by <a href=\"https://infinitegossip.substack.com/\">Max Lavergne</a></p>\n<p>There should be a guy who every morning rides his bicycle down to the main street and sets up a small glass case of beautiful cakes he has made. He should sell the cakes at a reasonable price to whoever comes. The cakes should be both beautiful and inspiring. They should be sumptuously iced and decorated with fruits and sugared flowers which are not only lovely to behold but genuinely delicious. He should sit on a low half wall and read a newspaper folded into quarters until the cakes are all sold. As soon as the last one is sold he should tie the glass case to the back of his bike and cycle to the market to buy fresh eggs and flour, chocolate, fruit, all the things he needs to make cakes for tomorrow. And then he should ride his bicycle home, where he should kiss the top of the low door frame leading into his widower&rsquo;s cottage because it will always remind him of her. And then he makes the cakes for the next day. Now that&rsquo;s what should happen. It should be happening already, in towns all over the country. Hell, all over the world. If it&rsquo;s not then fuck it. Let the bombs fall. Let them turn the beaches to glass. Return us to hunter gatherers, cowering in caves.

				"content_text": "by [Max Lavergne](https://infinitegossip.substack.com/)\n\nThere should be a guy who every morning rides his bicycle down to the main street and sets up a small glass case of beautiful cakes he has made. He should sell the cakes at a reasonable price to whoever comes. The cakes should be both beautiful and inspiring. They should be sumptuously iced and decorated with fruits and sugared flowers which are not only lovely to behold but genuinely delicious. He should sit on a low half wall and read a newspaper folded into quarters until the cakes are all sold. As soon as the last one is sold he should tie the glass case to the back of his bike and cycle to the market to buy fresh eggs and flour, chocolate, fruit, all the things he needs to make cakes for tomorrow. And then he should ride his bicycle home, where he should kiss the top of the low door frame leading into his widower's cottage because it will always remind him of her. And then he makes the cakes for the next day. Now that's what should happen. It should be happening already, in towns all over the country. Hell, all over the world. If it's not then fuck it. Let the bombs fall. Let them turn the beaches to glass. Return us to hunter gatherers, cowering in caves. Miserable dirty people dying of cold when it rains for too long. Let us slowly work our way back up if we can't get even that part right when it should be so obvious. See if the next crop are smarter. And if they aren't then try again. As long as it takes. Let our distant descendents hide in the shadows of the brick walls we built. I don't think that's too extreme.\n\n[Link to original](https://infinitegossip.substack.com/p/there-should-be-a-guy)\n\n",

If you seek a 'why' for each picture, you become more selective. You aren't merely snapping whoever walks past or seems less intimidating to you. Instead, you're sensitised to what is notable about people and situations — strong emotions, interesting gestures, punchy outfits, characterful faces, strange juxtapositions. Like all creative pursuits — success is as much about refining your taste as it is about sharpening your skills. \n- lastly, if you might interrupt someone's day you should have a reason for doing so. In street photography, you're collaborating with the world — and so it's important that you treat your subjects with the respect they deserve. \n",
